# Snorpy
Snorpy is a simple Snort rule creator / builder / maker made originally with python but I made the most recent version with Node and jquery. 

This sample can be seen at <a href="http://snorpy.com">Snorpy.com</a>

The install, simply download this repo. Unzip the node-modules. Then from command line run app.js with "node app.js" etc...

Should be that easy.
