# Snorpy
Snorpy is a python script the gives a interface to help those new to snort create rules and append them to their local ruleset.


I precompiled a Windows version .exe for use. The python script is also there. I plan to make a website for a gui here in the near future. Will be:

snorpy.com


This is the initial version. If you have any errors, please send them to me to improve at chrisjd20/@/gmail.com

I only performed minimal testing to verify base functionality worked.
