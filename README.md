# Snorpy
Snorpy is a python script the gives a interface to help those new to snort create rules and append them to their local ruleset.


I precompiled a Windows version .exe and a linux binary for Ubuntu 64 bit versions. The python script is also there. I plan to make a website for a gui here in the near future. Will be:

snorpy.com
