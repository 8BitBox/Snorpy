# Snorpy
Snorpy is a simple Snort rule creator / builder / maker made originally with python but I made the most recent version with Node and jquery. 

This sample can be seen at <a href="http://snorpy.com">Snorpy.com</a>


#Install
1. Install nodejs
2. Download repo
3. Unzip the file name node_modules.zip
4. cd /to/the/path/of/app.js
5. run the following command: "node app.js"

Should be that easy.
